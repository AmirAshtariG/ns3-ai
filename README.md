# ns3-ai

## Description
 The [nsâ€“3](https://www.nsnam.org/) simulator is an open-source networking simulation tool implemented by C++ and wildly used for network research and education. Currently, more and more researchers are willing to apply AI algorithms to network research. Most AI algorithms are likely to rely on open source frameworks such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). These two parts are developed independently and extremely hard to merge, so it is more reasonable and convenient to connect these two tasks with data interaction. Our model provides a high-efficiency solution to enable the data interaction between ns-3 and other python based AI frameworks.

 Inspired by [ns3-gym](https://github.com/tkn-tub/ns3-gym), but using a different approach which is faster and more flexible.

### Features
- High-performance data interaction module (using shared memory). 
- Provide a high-level interface for different AI algorithms.
- Easy to integrate with other AI frameworks.


## Installation
### 1. Install this module in ns-3
#### Get ns-3:  
This module needs to be built within ns-3, so you need to get a ns-3-dev or other ns-3 codes first.

Check [ns-3 installation wiki](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation) for detailed instructions.

#### Add this module
```
cd $YOUR_NS3_CODE/src
git clone https://github.com/hust-diangroup/ns3-ai.git
```

#### Rebuild ns-3
```
./waf configure
./waf
```

### 2. Add Python interface

#### Install
Python3 is used and tested.

```
cd $YOUR_NS3_CODE/src/ns-ai/py_interface

python setup.py install --user
```

#### Baisc usage
```
import py_interface
py_interface.Init(1234, 4096) # key poolSize
v = NS3BigVar(233, c_int*10)
with v as o:
    for i in range(10):
        o[i] = c_int(i)
    print(*o)
py_interface.FreeMemory()
```

## Examples
### [RL-TCP](https://github.com/hust-diangroup/ns3-ai/blob/master/example/rl-tcp/RL-TCP-en.md)
This example is inspired by [ns3-gym example](https://github.com/tkn-tub/ns3-gym#rl-tcp). We bulid this example for the benchmarking and to compare with their module.

#### Build and Run
Run ns-3 example:
```
cp -r src/ns3-ai/example/rl-tcp scratch/

./waf --run "rl-tcp"
```
Run Python code:
```
cd src/ns3-ai/example/rl-tcp/

python testtcp.py
```
**NOTE: Currently the RL test in python script is not fully enabled, coming soon.**

#### Future plan
- Full RL-TCP example - debugging.
- LTE CQI prediction with Deep learning - ns-3 parts finished.
